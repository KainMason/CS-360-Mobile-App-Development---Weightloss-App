# CS-360-Mobile-App-Development---Weightloss-App

The app I built was a weight-tracking tool designed to help users monitor their progress and stay motivated. It focused on being easy to use, with simple navigation and clear layouts to support users who just want to quickly log their weight and check progress.

The app included a login screen, a dashboard for viewing weight trends, an input screen to log new entries, and a settings screen. I kept the design clean and user-centered by avoiding clutter and focusing on readability and ease of use. I think the designs worked well because everything was straightforward, and users wouldn’t need to guess what to do.

For the coding process, I broke it down into small tasks—getting each screen working before moving on. I ran into some issues (including a few crashes), but taking it step by step and testing after each change helped a lot. I’ll definitely use that approach again in the future.

I tested the app using the Android emulator, checking each screen and interaction to make sure it all worked. This was really important because even small bugs caused crashes or weird behavior. Testing helped me catch and fix a lot of that.

One challenge I had was getting navigation between screens to work right. At first, the app wouldn’t switch between activities properly, but I figured out how to use intents and pass data correctly.

Overall, I think I showed my skills best in how I tied together the UI and functionality. The app isn’t perfect, but it works, and it shows what I’ve learned about mobile dev and user-focused design.
